"""
Jorge's Seller Bot - Q1-Q4 Qualification Framework

Implements Jorge's confrontational 4-question qualification sequence:
Q1: Property condition (honest assessment)
Q2: Price expectation (realistic valuation)
Q3: Motivation to sell (urgency and reason)
Q4: Offer acceptance (closing question with 2-3 week timeline)

State Machine Flow:
Q0 (Greeting) → Q1 (Condition) → Q2 (Price) → Q3 (Motivation) → Q4 (Offer) → Qualified

Temperature Scoring:
- HOT: All 4 questions answered + offer accepted + timeline OK
- WARM: All 4 questions answered + reasonable responses
- COLD: <4 questions or disqualifying responses
